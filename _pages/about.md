I am a technology and engineering teacher currently working in a K-5 setting. I work to create a critical consciousness around technology, encouraging students to think about the many histories and possible futures of technology, the many hands required to bring technology into being, and the physical infrastructures that are often ignored in using digital technologies. In my K-5 classes, I also look at how to develop media and AI literacy, 2D and 3D design skills, and computational thinking, particularly for neurodiverse learners.

### Research Interests 
- How technologies in schools change the labor of teaching and the experience of learning
- Taking a social and historical lens to educational technology
- Educational technologies that may be seen as "failed" or forgotten
- Using participatory and speculative design to explore other models of educational technology, especially outside the forces of markets

#### Other Interests
- Public transit
- Cycling
- Architecture
- Infrastructure and ports
